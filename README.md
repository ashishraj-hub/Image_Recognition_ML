# 🖼️ Image Recognition ML — Bootcamp Project

Welcome to the **Image Recognition ML** project, developed as part of a bootcamp focused on applying machine learning to computer vision tasks. This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a model that can classify images using supervised learning techniques.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To create a machine learning model capable of recognizing and classifying images into predefined categories. The project walks through the full ML pipeline—from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source:** Image dataset (details assumed from notebook context)
- **Format:** Likely structured as folders per class or labeled CSV
- **Classes:** Multiple image categories (e.g., animals, objects, etc.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning framework
- **OpenCV / PIL**: Image processing
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visualization
- **Google Colab**: Development environment

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading**
   - Import and visualize image samples
   - Resize and normalize images

2. **Model Building**
   - Define CNN architecture
   - Compile and train the model

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy and loss metrics
   - Confusion matrix and classification report

4. **Prediction**
   - Test model on unseen images
   - Display predicted labels


## 🏅 Achievements

✅ Completed as part of a bootcamp  
📜 Earned both **Participation Certificate** and **Project Completion Certificate** for successfully building and presenting the model
